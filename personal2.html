      <div id="rightpersonal2"><p>Welcome to my personal page! Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me.</p>
      <p>My name's Taylor. I was born and raised in Washington D.C. and I am currently living in Pittsburgh, PA. I graduated from Pitt with the class of 2013, double majoring in Philosophy and Political Science with a minor in Studio Arts.</p>
      <p>I'm fascinated with understanding how things work. I'm a deductive learner, and only feel that I really understand something when I know it from top to bottom. One of my favorite projects as a kid was assembling and building a computer from scratch with my dad (quad core intel water cooled w/ 2x 750 MB vid boards in SLI, 2x 150 GB WD raptors w/ RAID 0 config and 2x 150 MB Corsair memory sticks).<p>
      <p>I like movies with subtitles, painting in my spare time, traveling and experiencing new cultures, and reading TechCrunch religiously.</p>
      <p>Having already experienced starting my own company, my ultimate goal is to start one again within the next 4 years. I'm attracted to tech because of the speed at which it can bring truly valuable products to market, and I'm excited to be able to contribute something as well.</p>
